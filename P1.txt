Project discription
    The xarn_language.html presents users with three text input fields with the prompts "The word", "From native", and "New language" and a submit button. Once submitted, the inputs are given over GET to xarn_translate.cgi.
    The cgi file processes the inputs and, if all fields were filled in, attempts to translate the given word from the native language to the new language, using data from xarn_language.txt.
    The output screen shows the given input on seperate lines, the prompts in blue if the givens were valid and red if they were not (along with "invalid" instead of the input), irrespective of if the error is a blank. This is followed by "Translation: " and, if there were no invalid inputs, the translation if one could be found or "unkown" if it couldn't be in green either way. If there were invalid inputs, the output is "Translation: Invalid" in all red.


Questions:
What does your CGI do if one of the fields is completely missing? 
    For each field, the CGI checks if any of them are 'none', which is what the HTML gives if the field is completely missing. If this is the case, an error is indicated, no translation is attempted, and the field(s) is red in the output ("invalid" is shown where the input would be).

What does your CGI do if the value of a field is blank?
    As with a completely missing field, the CGI checks for '', indicating no input and does the same thing (error indicated, translation not attempted, and the field along with "invalid" is shown in red).

Did you test your CGI with a client such as curl?
    Yes, a little bit.

What happens if one of the field values submitted is a string of 100 chars? 1000? 10000?
    The program can handle up to about 7500 characters total (among all three fields) so it should be able to handle 100 or 1000 character words and strings (spaces are conserved while newline characters are not). More characters results in a "URL length is too long" sever error.

How did you test the previous question?
    We copied long strings from pdfs and checked their character length with the wordcount feature in MS word.
